# VoiceAssistant
 A fully functional chatbot that can handle many features and do several tasks for you - just with some simple voice commands. Tasks include: Playing music, drafting emails, sending twerets, and much more!

 Setup:

 - Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - If you're planning on using the bot to make tweets, make sure to create a twitter developers accunt if you haven't already. You can find it [here](https://https://developer.twitter.com/en)
 - Additionally, you will need an [Open Weather Map Api](https://openweathermap.org) account to access the weather
 - Lastly, you will need to make a config.py document which will contain all the api keys, passwords, and email contacts. The format should look something like this:
`CONSUMER_KEY = 'FIi7QWChnbWDsoKwLpQdA8eKp'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'd2ONTfoKcR9ZlSlDCMaScrS7edweajaolUHfxpIVdawKCNEq80'
ACCESS_KEY = '1210674626319155205-AqC28xW8hfrRw8OQESP9mOTzVtHI1z'
ACCESS_SECRET = 'ztKJJ6AqWY1TF9rod8zLR29MEpgQ6ZCXz7yUPw4ds0XPa'

EMAIL_USERNAME = 'sunnyr447@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'JPNAGAr6'

email_recipients = {
    'dad': ['svr4@yahoo.com', 'Sunil Rao'],
    'mom': ['shobhasr6@gmail.com', 'Shobha Rao'],
    'avani': ['skystarry569@gmail.com', 'Avani Rao']
}

WEATHER_API_KEY = "e52d04faf9791cb59328bb593790255b"`
